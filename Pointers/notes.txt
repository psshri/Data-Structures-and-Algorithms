Pointers are variables that store the address of another variables

Function call in which, instead of passing the value of a variable, we pass the
address of the variable, so that we have a reference to the variable and we can
dereference it and perform some operations is called call by reference. if we
use pointers as function arguments then we are using call by reference. Call by
reference can save us a lot of memory because instead of creating a copy of
large and complex  data type, we just use a reference to it.
