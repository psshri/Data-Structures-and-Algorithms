The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate
on them, so that no other part of the code can access this data except the 
function.

OOPs concept: classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism,
inheritance

Class
- user defined data type
- it holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed
  by creating an instance of the class
- a class is like a blueprint for an object

Object
- an object is an instance of a class 
- when a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated
  (ie when an object is created) memory is allocated

Encapsulation
- binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them
- encapsulation also leads to data abstraction or hiding

Abstraction
- abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details
- abstraction can be implemented using classes. the class helps us to group data
  members and member functions using available access specifiers. a class can
  decide which data member will be visible to the outside world and which not

Polymorphism
- C++ supports operator overloading and function overloading
- operator overloading: the process of making an operator to exhibit different
  behaviours in different instances is known as operator overloading
- function overloading: function overloading is using a single function name
  to perform different types of task
- polymorphism is extensively used in implementing inheritance 

Inheritance
- The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from 
  another class is called inheritance
- sub class: the class that inherits properties from another class is called
  sub class or derived class
- super class: the class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called 
  base class or super class

Dynamic Binding
- in dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to function call is 
  decided at runtime. C++ has virtual functions to support this

Message Passing
- message passing involves specifying the name of the object, the name of the 
  function and the information to be sent

C++ Classes and Objects

Accessing a data member depends solely on the access control of that data member.
This access control is given by access modifiers in C++. there are three access
modifiers: public, private, protected

There are two ways to define a member function
- inside class definition
- outside class definition

Constructors
- constructors are special class members which are called by the compiler
  every time an object of that class is instantiated. constructors have the same
  name as the class and may be defined inside or outside the class definition
- there are three types of constructors: default constructors, parameterized
  constructors, copy constructors
- a copy constructor creates a new object, which is exact copy of the existing 
  object. the compiler provides a default copy constructor to all the classes
  syntax: class-name (class-name &){}

Destructors
- destructor is another special member function that is called by the compiler 
  when the scope of the object ends

we can create an instance of a class just after its definition by writing 
'instance;' just after } brace

source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-modifiers-in-c/   

access modifiers or access specifiers in a class set some restrictions on the 
class members so that they can't be directly accessed by the outside functions

there are 3 type of access modifiers in c++: public, private, protected; default
is private

public: all class members declared under public specifier will be available to
everyone. the data members and member functions declared as public can be 
accessed by other classes and functions too.

private: only the member functions or the friend functions are allowed to 
access the private data members of the class

protected: similar to private access modifier, but the class members declared 
as protected can be accessed by any subclass (derived class) of that class as well
this access through inheritance can alter the access modifier of the elements 
of base class in derived class depending on the mode of inheritance.

FRIEND CLASS AND FUNCTION IN C++

a friend class can access private and protected members of other classes, it is
sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private and protected 
members of other classes

friend function: like a friend class, a friend function can be granted special
access to private and protected members of a class in C++. they are the non
member functions that can access and manipulate the private and protected 
members of the class for they are declared as friends. 

a friend function can be:
- a global function
- a member function of another class

syntax for a global function
friend return_type function_name (arguments); 

syntax for a member function of another class
friend return_type class_name::function_name (arguments);

member function of another class as friend function: the order in which we 
define the friend function of another class is important and should be taken
care of. we always have to define both the classes before the function 
definition

a friend function is a special function in C++ that inspite of not being a 
member function of a class, has the privilege to access the private and 
protected data of a class

a friend function can be decalared in any section of the class ie public, 
private, protected

imp points of friend functions and classes:
- can access members w/o the need to inherite the class
- can act as bridge b/w two classes by accessing their private data
- friend functions cannot do any run-time polymorphism in their members
- friendship is not mutual, if class a is a friend of b, then b doesn't become 
  friend of a
- friendship is not inherited
