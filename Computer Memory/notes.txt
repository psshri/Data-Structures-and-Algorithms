RAM is also called as Main Memory

A computer program uses RAM for its execution
A computer program is stored in hard disk

Stack section of the RAM is used for functions calls for a program

Heap section of the RAM is used to allocate dynamic memory for data

If we keep on requesting memory from heap and do not free the space after its 
intended usage, then this condition is known as memory leak

A compiler converts a program written in a high level language to machine level
language (which is binary). The compiler creates an executable file, which has 
the extension of .exe on windows

A number of programs are executed at the same time, so CPU and RAM are shared
by all the programs. Operating System is responsible to share CPU and RAM 
between the programs.
